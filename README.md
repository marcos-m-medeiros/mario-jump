# Mario Jump

This is a simple game created in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML where the character jumps when any key on the keyboard is pressed, while pipes move through the scene. The goal is to prevent the character from touching the pipes, as this will result in the end of the game.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your web browser.
2. Press any key on the keyboard to make the character jump.
3. Avoid letting the character touch the pipes as they move across the screen.
4. The game ends when the character touches a pipe.
